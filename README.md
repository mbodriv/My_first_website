# Maria Bodero – Personal Portfolio

This website was built to share a bit about my background, interests, and what I’ve been learning as I explore coding and technology.  
It’s a simple and clean design made with HTML and CSS, focused on usability and responsive layout.

## About the Website

The site has two main pages:
- **Home:** Includes a short introduction, an “About Me” section, what I’m currently learning, and a contact form.  
- **Resume:** A summary of my professional experience, education, and key skills, plus a link to download my full resume in PDF format.
